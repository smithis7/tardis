# tardis_impact workflow

This is assuming that you have access to the master branch.

When you want to edit the code, follow these steps:

#### Step 1:
In your terminal, type ```git fetch origin``` and then ```git merge```.

#### Step 2:
Do whatever you are trying to do with ads.ipynb and README--IMPORTANT_and_progress_updates.md (and save your work). Before step 4, **make sure that your key is not in the ads.ipynb document**.

#### Step 3:
When you are done, in the terminal, do ```git add ads.ipynb``` and ```git add README--IMPORTANT_and_progress_updates.md```.

#### Step 4:
In the terminal, do ```git commit -m "message about your commit"```.

#### Step 5:
In the terminal, do ```git push origin```.


If you need to make more edits and Isaac has not edited since, skip step 1.
